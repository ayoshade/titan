# Verification

## Completed during setup

- All manifest packages installed from Arch repositories, including Hyprland
  0.56.2-3 and Quickshell 0.3.1-1.
- `Hyprland --verify-config`: config ok; live `hyprctl configerrors`: empty.
- Bash syntax checked for all scripts; bootstrap run twice successfully.
- Live Quickshell loaded without runtime warnings after corrections.
- IPC exercised for launcher, controls, notifications, session, close and
  brightness OSD. No suspend, shutdown or reboot action was executed.
- Desktop, control center, launcher and notification history visually inspected
  at the physical 1366×768 resolution.
- Network list populated through native API without disconnecting Ethernet.
- Native notification delivered and rendered in retained history.
- PipeWire sink volume, battery, brightness, and power profile populated.
- Kitty and Thunar launched; Hyprland reports `xwayland: false` for both.
- Hyprland DPMS-on Lua dispatcher returned ok.
- GTK, Hyprland and core XDG portals active.
- NetworkManager, Bluetooth, power profiles and UFW remain active.
- Quickshell resident memory observed around 202 MiB after opening all panels;
  process lifetime CPU around 0.9% during interactive checks. These are a brief
  observation, not a steady-state benchmark.

## Hands-on checks still required

1. Super+L: lock screen renders; type the local password and unlock.
2. Suspend from the session menu: resume requires authentication; display,
   audio, Bluetooth and network recover.
3. Test actual speaker/microphone output, audio-device switching, brightness
   keys and media playback with an MPRIS-capable application.
4. Join a known Wi-Fi network and pair a Bluetooth device. Ethernet remained
   connected during setup; credentials and radio state were not changed.
5. Print: select a region, verify the saved PNG and clipboard paste.
6. Firefox: test file dialogs and an explicit screen-sharing request. Portal
   activation was checked; no external call was initiated.
7. Plug in an external monitor if used; verify scaling, bar and focused-screen
   overlays. Only the internal screen was available during setup.

Run `~/dotfiles/scripts/doctor` for repeatable static/package/service checks.
The script does not claim to validate real authentication, suspend, hardware
output, screen-share negotiation or device pairing.
